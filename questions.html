                I will use a Trello board to plan and organise the task required for making my website. <br>
                This will allow me to break down what tasks I'll need to complete using HTML and CSS. <br>
                My plan is to make a website that gives information about my Twitch channel <br>
                and allows visitors to find my social media contacts.

                Trello will be helpful in keeping my project plan organised. <br>
                I'll be writing my HTML and CSS code in VSCode which is a very useful tool for making sure all my syntax is correct. <br>
                I'll also be using a collection of images as assets for my website and an uploaded font. <br>
                Finally I'll be hosting the website with GitHub pages so it will be available on the web.

                The tools used (Trello, VSCode, GitHub pages) are very appropriate for the scope of this project. <br>
                It seems this website would be easy to maintain with the tools used.

                While putting the site together, it's easy to test it looks as intended by opening the site in a web browser. <br>
                I have used .html files for the different pages with a single .css file for all the styling <br>
                I've also included a folder of .png files of the images used, and a .ttf for the font. <br>
                The main consideration regarding accessibility would be whether the site is compatible with screen readers. <br>
                To that end, all my images have alt text which helps to explain what they are. <br>
                I also chosen colours which contrast well so the text is readable, and I've increased the font size as well.

                We started this project before having all the HTML and CSS methods explained to us, <br>
                this put limitations on the initial planning of the website. <br>
                Now that I have a better idea of how HTML and CSS work, I would have planned the site out differently, <br>
                This would have allowed me to code everything up more efficiently.

                The final website is a place explaining what I do on my Twitch channel, <br>
                with links to the channel and my related social media pages. <br>
                It has a functional navigation bar to move between the different pages, <br>
                and also shows the user what page they're on. <br>
                All the content is formatted to be clear and easily readable, and centred on the page. <br>
                The final site functions in the way I wanted it to when I started the project.
